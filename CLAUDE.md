## Writing Style Preferences

**Punctuation:**
- Prefer commas over em dashes in most cases
- Use periods to break up long sentences instead of em dashes
- Use colons when introducing a list or explanation (e.g., "existed before: a dating site")
- Em dashes are OK sparingly for emphasis or dramatic pause, but default to simpler punctuation

**Examples of preferred style:**
- "my whole life, and that came with..." (not "my whole life—and that came with...")
- "Tell us what matters most to you. It takes about 2 minutes..." (not "...to you—it takes about 2 minutes...")
- "your place. You'll find a community..." (not "your place—you'll find a community...")
