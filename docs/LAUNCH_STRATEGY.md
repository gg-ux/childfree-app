# Chosn Launch Strategy
## Product Requirements Document + Marketing Plan

**Last Updated:** January 2026
**Status:** Pre-Launch
**Timeline:** 4-6 months to product launch

---

## Executive Summary

Chosn is a dating and community platform exclusively for childfree adults. This document outlines a phased approach to launch that solves the critical "chicken and egg" problem facing all dating apps: you need users to attract users.

**The Strategy:** Launch community features globally first (no geographic density required), then layer dating features city-by-city once you have a critical mass of engaged users.

**Why This Works:**
- Community features (forums, discussions) work with distributed users
- Dating features require geographic density (150+ users per city)
- Community users become your dating user base
- You build trust and brand before asking people to date through you

---

## Current State

### What You Have
- [x] Landing page with waitlist
- [x] Blog with 16 articles (SEO foundation)
- [x] Pinterest presence
- [x] Survey (rough draft)
- [x] Database schema designed
- [x] Brand identity established

### What You Don't Have Yet
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] User profiles
- [ ] Matching/discovery system
- [ ] Messaging system
- [ ] Community/forum features
- [ ] Mobile apps (web-first is fine for MVP)

---

## The Cold Start Problem

**The Core Challenge:** A single user on a dating app gets zero value. Even 100 users spread across the US provides zero value. You need *density*.

**Research Findings:**
- Timeleft (dating app) only launched in cities with 151+ signups
- Tinder acquired 15,000 users on college campuses before broader launch
- 5,000 users distributed across the US = likely zero dates
- Cost per install via ads: $4-8 for niche demographics (unsustainable without funding)

**Our Solution:**
1. Build community features that work globally (no density required)
2. Use community to build waitlist density in specific cities
3. Launch dating features only in cities with 150+ waitlist signups
4. Expand city-by-city as each reaches critical mass

- Blog: 1 post every 2 weeks

**Survey Distribution (After 4 weeks of Reddit presence)**

## Phase 2: Dating MVP (Weeks 13-20)

### Goals
- Launch dating features in first city
- Prove the matching concept works
- Gather dating-specific feedback

### Geographic Strategy

**First City: Los Angeles**

LA is your first launch city because:
1. You're there (can host events, build community in person)
2. Massive population (13M metro) = large childfree population
3. Entertainment/creative industry = high DINK concentration
4. Progressive culture supportive of childfree lifestyle
5. Strong brunch/social scene for IRL events

**LA-Specific Opportunities:**
- Childfree Meetup groups in LA area
- WeHo/Silver Lake/Echo Park = high concentration of childfree millennials
- Partner with dog-friendly venues (childfree people love pets)
- Beach/hiking meetups align with LA lifestyle

**Expansion Order (After LA):**
1. San Diego (nearby, similar demo)
2. SF Bay Area (high childfree rates)
3. Portland/Seattle (progressive corridor)
4. Austin/Denver (next tier)

**Launch Threshold:** Do not launch dating in a city until you have 150+ waitlist signups from that metro area.

### Product Requirements

**Must Have (Dating MVP)**
| Feature | Description | Est. Time |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Extended profiles | Photos, prompts, preferences, seeking type | 1 week |

| Like/pass system | Express interest (doesn't need to be swipe) | 1 week |
| Matching | Mutual interest = match | 3-4 days |
| 1:1 messaging | Chat between matched users | 1-2 weeks |
| Basic safety | Photo guidelines, report/block | 1 week |

**Nice to Have (Post-MVP)**
- Video/voice notes
- Prompt-based likes (like Hinge)

- Icebreaker suggestions

### Marketing Work

**City-Specific Campaign**
- Create city-specific landing page or filter
- "Chosn is coming to [City] - join the waitlist"
- Partner with local childfree Meetup groups
- Consider hosting a launch event (IRL meetup)

**Event-Driven Launch (Tinder's Playbook)**
- Host a childfree mixer/happy hour in launch city
- Make Chosn signup part of the "ticket"
- Creates instant user density + word of mouth
- Budget: $200-500 for venue/drinks

### Milestones
- [ ] 2,000 total waitlist signups

## Marketing Plan Summary

### Budget: $0-500 (Bootstrap Phase)

| Channel | Investment | Expected Return | Timeline |
|---------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Reddit (organic) | Time only | 100-500 users | 3-6 months |
| LinkedIn (founder brand) | Time only | 50-200 signups | Ongoing |
| Pinterest | Time only | SEO + awareness | Ongoing |
| Blog/SEO | Time only | Long-tail traffic | 6-12 months |
| Podcast outreach | Time only | 50-200 per appearance | As booked |
| Launch event | $200-500 | 50-100 users | At city launch |
| Product Hunt | Time only | 200-1000 users | Once ready |

### Content Calendar

**Weekly Cadence:**
- Monday: Reddit engagement (3-5 comments in r/truechildfree)
- Tuesday: LinkedIn post (founder journey)
- Wednesday: Reddit engagement
- Thursday: Pinterest pins (2-3)
- Friday: Reddit engagement
- Weekend: Blog post (bi-weekly)

### Community Engagement Rules

**The 90-9-1 Rule:**
- 90% of content = pure value (insights, answering questions, sharing experiences)
- 9% = soft mentions of what you're building
- 1% = direct promotion

**Never:**
- Astroturf (fake accounts, planted questions)
- Promote before building trust (3-6 months)
- Post in hostile communities (r/childfree main)
- Spam multiple subreddits simultaneously

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Pre-Launch
- Waitlist signups (total + by city)
- Waitlist conversion rate
- Survey responses
- Email open rates
- Reddit karma/engagement

### Post-Launch (Community)
- Registered users
- Weekly active users (WAU)
- Posts per week
- Comments per post
- Retention (Week 1, Week 4)

### Post-Launch (Dating)
- Profiles created
- Daily active users (DAU)
- Matches per user
- Messages sent
- Match-to-conversation rate

### North Star Metric
**Meaningful connections made** (matches that lead to messages, friendships formed, dates scheduled)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Not enough users in any city
**Mitigation:** Launch community first (no density required). Use community engagement to build city-specific waitlists.

### Risk: Users sign up but don't engage
**Mitigation:** Email sequences, push notifications, weekly digests. Make community valuable enough to return to.

### Risk: Reddit promotion backfires
**Mitigation:** 3-6 months of genuine engagement before any promotion. Always ask mod permission. Be transparent about being a founder.

### Risk: Development takes longer than expected
**Mitigation:** Ruthlessly prioritize MVP features. Launch community before dating. Use no-code tools where possible.

### Risk: Competition launches similar product
**Mitigation:** Move fast, build community moat. Competitors can copy features but not community relationships.

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
| App | Status | Weakness |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Childfree Connection | Active | Limited features, small user base |
| CFdating.com | Active | Dated UX, web-only |
| Kindred | Shut down | Couldn't achieve viability |

### Indirect Competitors
- Bumble/Hinge with "don't want kids" filter
- General childfree Facebook groups
- r/cf4cf subreddit

### Your Differentiation
1. **Childfree-first, not an afterthought** - Built for this community, not a filter added later
2. **Community + Dating** - Not just matching, but belonging
3. **Verification** - Actually childfree, not "open to kids someday"
4. **Modern UX** - Clean, thoughtful design (your strength)
