If you're childfree and dating, you've probably experienced the frustration: you match with someone, conversation flows, you meet up—and then somewhere between the appetizers and the main course, they mention wanting kids "someday."

Back to square one.

## The Filter Problem

Most mainstream dating apps have added "doesn't want children" as a preference filter. Problem solved, right?

Not quite.

Here's what actually happens:

**Filters get ignored.** Many users skip over preference settings entirely, or change their mind about what they're looking for week to week.

**"Maybe" means "yes."** A surprising number of people select "not sure" or "open to kids" when they actually want children—they just don't want to seem too eager about it.

**It's treated as a preference, not a value.** Whether you want kids isn't like preferring tall people or dog lovers. It's a fundamental life direction that affects everything.

## More Than a Checkbox

The childfree lifestyle isn't just about not having children. It's about how you spend your time, money, and energy. It's about your travel plans, your career ambitions, your retirement dreams. It's about building a life that's intentionally designed around your values.

That's why filtering for "no kids" on a mainstream app still leaves you swimming in a sea of incompatibility.

## What We're Building Different

Chosn isn't a dating app with a childfree filter. It's a platform built from the ground up for people who've made this choice.

**Shared context from day one.** Everyone on Chosn is childfree. No awkward conversations. No dealbreaker surprises.

**Community, not just dating.** Looking for friends who get it? Activity partners? Your chosen family? We're building for all of it.

**Values-first matching.** We go deeper than surface preferences to connect people who actually align on what matters.

## The Future of Childfree Connection

We believe childfree adults deserve better than being an afterthought checkbox on apps designed for everyone else.

We're building the platform we wished existed. And we think you're going to love it.
