If you've ever asked a doctor about sterilization as a childfree person, you've probably heard some version of: "You're too young. You'll regret it."

But what does the research actually say? Let's look at the data.

## The Regret Myth

The fear of regret is the most common reason doctors cite for denying sterilization to childfree patients. But here's what studies actually show:

**Only about 1% of childfree women who obtain sterilization report regret.** That's dramatically lower than the often-cited 20% regret rate—which comes from studies of women who had children *before* sterilization.

The distinction matters. People who are certain they don't want children are fundamentally different from people who've completed their families.

## What the Studies Found

A 2023 study published in *Psychology of Women Quarterly* compared childfree individuals who obtained sterilization with those who were denied:

- Those who obtained sterilization reported **higher self-esteem**
- They experienced **better sexual quality of life**
- They showed **higher overall psychological well-being**

Notably, age didn't predict these outcomes. Whether someone was 25 or 35 when sterilized made no difference in their satisfaction.

## The Real Regret

Here's what researchers found that doctors rarely mention: **being denied sterilization is associated with worse outcomes** than obtaining it.

People who wanted sterilization but were refused reported:
- Lower well-being
- More frustration with healthcare
- Continued anxiety about unwanted pregnancy

The assumption that "waiting" protects people from regret isn't supported by evidence.

## Why Doctors Still Say No

Despite the research, many physicians remain reluctant to perform sterilization on childfree patients. Common reasons include:

- **Pronatalist bias**: The assumption that everyone should want children
- **Paternalism**: Believing they know better than the patient
- **Fear of liability**: Concern about being blamed if someone changes their mind
- **Outdated training**: Medical education that hasn't kept pace with research

## Finding the Right Provider

If you're seeking sterilization, know that you have options:

1. **Be direct**: State clearly that you've researched this decision thoroughly
2. **Document your request**: If denied, ask for it to be noted in your medical record
3. **Seek specialists**: Some gynecologists specifically welcome childfree patients
4. **Know your rights**: In most places, you have the right to this procedure if you're a legal adult

## The Bottom Line

The data is clear: childfree people who obtain sterilization are overwhelmingly satisfied with their decision. The regret narrative isn't supported by evidence—it's a reflection of cultural assumptions about what people "should" want.

You know yourself better than anyone. Trust that.
