The childfree community is growing—and the data proves it. If you've ever felt like you're part of a small minority for choosing not to have children, the research might surprise you.

## Childfree By Choice: A Growing Demographic

A landmark Michigan State University study tracked over 20 years of data from the National Survey of Family Growth—and the shift is striking.

<LineChart title="% of non-parents who are childfree by choice" data={[{ year: 2002, value: 14 }, { year: 2008, value: 16 }, { year: 2015, value: 20 }, { year: 2019, value: 24 }, { year: 2023, value: 29 }]} color="forest" />

The number has more than doubled from 14% to 29% in just two decades, representing a fundamental shift in how Americans think about family, fulfillment, and lifestyle choices.

## How Many Childfree Adults Are There?

<StatCards

  bigNumber={{ value: "50-60M", label: "Childfree adults in America" }}
/>

Based on current research, approximately **1 in 5 adults** (21.6%) identify as childfree by choice. Applied to the U.S. adult population of roughly 260 million, that translates to somewhere between **50 and 60 million childfree adults** in America alone.

To put that in perspective: there are more childfree adults in the U.S. than the entire population of Spain.

## The Pew Research Findings

A 2024 Pew Research Center survey added even more context to these numbers. **47% of adults under 50** without children say they're unlikely to ever have kids—up 10 percentage points from 2018.

  before={{ label: "2018", value: 37 }}
  after={{ label: "2024", value: 47 }}
/>

Among those who say they're unlikely to have children, **57% simply don't want to**. And **64% of young women** cite "just don't want to" as their primary reason, compared to 50% of men.

  ]}
/>

## Why the Shift?

The research points to several factors driving this change:

**It's not just about money.** While 36% cite affordability concerns, the most common reason is simply personal preference. People are increasingly comfortable saying "this isn't the life I want."

**It's not a crisis—it's a choice.** Unlike previous generations where childlessness was often involuntary, today's childfree adults are making intentional decisions about their lives.

**Social acceptance is growing.** The Pew Research Center found that 81% of Americans now think it's completely or somewhat acceptable for a married couple to choose not to have children.

## What This Means for You

If you're childfree, you're not an outlier. You're part of a significant and growing demographic that's reshaping what "family" means in America.

Yet despite these numbers, there's still no dedicated space for childfree adults to connect—whether for dating, friendship, or community. That's exactly why we're building Chosn.
