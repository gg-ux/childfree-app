Where you live shapes your life. For childfree adults, the right city means access to great restaurants, cultural experiences, outdoor activities, and—most importantly—a community that gets it.

We analyzed cities based on factors that matter most to the childfree community: cost of living without kid-related expenses, nightlife and dining scenes, career opportunities, dating pools, and overall quality of life for adults without children.

## What Makes a City Great for Childfree Adults?

Before diving into the list, here's what we looked for:

- **Adult-focused amenities** — Restaurants, bars, cultural venues, and entertainment that aren't centered around families
- **Career opportunities** — Strong job markets, especially in industries that attract young professionals
- **Dating scene** — Active social scenes and higher concentrations of childfree singles
- **Cost of living** — Your money goes further when you're not paying for school districts
- **Outdoor activities** — Hiking, beaches, skiing—adventures that are easier without kids in tow
- **Walkability and transit** — Less need for minivans and suburban sprawl

## Finding Your City

The best city for you depends on what you value. Ask yourself:

- Do I prioritize outdoor activities or urban amenities?
- Is career growth or work-life balance more important?
- Do I want warm weather or am I okay with seasons?
- How important is affordability vs. access to opportunities?

## The Bigger Picture

Wherever you land, remember: you're not alone. The childfree community is growing, and cities are increasingly catering to adults who want rich, full lives that don't center around raising children.

The right city won't just tolerate your lifestyle—it'll celebrate it.
